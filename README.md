# Machine-Learning-Assignment

**Aim:**

Aims of this assignment are: 

a) to learn to identify machine learning techniques appropriate for a particular practical problem.

b) to undertake a comparative evaluation of several machine learning procedures when applied to the specific problem.

**NOTE: The zip files contains the dataset used in this problem**

**Identification of the problem type:**

The given type of problem is a binary classification type problem. Here, in this problem we need to predict whether the customers of travel insurance company would make a future claim or not. There are two possible outcomes which are as follows. Either the customer would make an insurance claim or the customer will not make the claim. So, this type of problem is a Binary classification problem. Binary classification is the type of machine learning problem where the goal is to categorize the data points in one of the two cases, here in our case it is either true or false.

**Requirement of data features for analyses:**

In order to make a perfect prediction for the travel insurance claim, the following features are required.

They are 
•	Age of the insured
•	Gender of the person 
•	Frequency of travel 
•	Coverage for medical expenses
